# html-template
A started template for HTML project.
Note that we organize the project in a way that is easy to maintain and understand:
- `css` folder for CSS files (although we are not expected to use CSS much)
- `js` folder for JavaScript files.
- `img` folder for images (you can also use internet images by providing the URL, but it is better to have a local copy)
